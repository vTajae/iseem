# Financial Data Integration with QuickBooks and Plaid

---

## üîß **Description**

This project involves building a backend Python server for a client, integrating financial data from QuickBooks and Plaid. I received approval from the client to showcase it here.

I chose Python for this project because I wanted to challenge myself to move away from TypeScript, which I had previously used for backend development. Express.js was my initial foray into backend development, but I felt it was time to level up and learn something new.

I decided to use FastAPI, having originally started with Django. I appreciated the simplicity and flexibility that FastAPI brought to the project. My goal was to test whether the API design pattern involving Repository, Service, and Route would work well in this new environment‚Äîand it did! This pattern helped me create a stable and organized API across different languages and projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **APIs Integrated**: QuickBooks API, Plaid API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React.js for authentication flows
- **Security**: Session management and authentication protocols

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Challenges and Solutions**

### OAuth Authentication Flows:
Coordinating OAuth authentication for both QuickBooks and Plaid presented a significant challenge. Handling callback URLs and managing access tokens securely between the frontend and backend required a deep understanding of the authentication flow. 

To tackle this, I implemented secure token handling mechanisms and followed OAuth best practices. I ensured the React frontend received the proper authorization codes and passed them to the Python backend, which handled token storage and user authentication securely.

### Sensitive Data Handling:
Dealing with sensitive financial data required stringent security measures. I implemented robust session management, encrypted sensitive information, and followed data protection best practices to ensure that user data was handled securely.
